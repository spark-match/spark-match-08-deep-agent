# Vocational Advisor Skill

## RIASEC Model (Holland Codes)

The RIASEC model classifies vocational interests into six types:

| Code | Type | Description | Example Careers |
|------|------|-------------|-----------------|
| R | Realistic | Hands-on, physical, mechanical work | Engineering, Construction, Agriculture |
| I | Investigative | Analytical, intellectual, scientific | Research, Medicine, Data Science |
| A | Artistic | Creative, expressive, unstructured | Design, Music, Writing |
| S | Social | Helping, teaching, counseling | Psychology, Education, Social Work |
| E | Enterprising | Leading, persuading, managing | Business, Law, Marketing |
| C | Conventional | Organizing, data, detail-oriented | Accounting, IT Admin, Logistics |

## How to use RIASEC codes

1. Each person gets a 3-letter code (e.g., IAS = Investigative-Artistic-Social)
2. The first letter is the dominant type
3. Careers also have RIASEC profiles
4. Match student profiles to career profiles for compatibility

## Assessment Flow

1. Ask questions that reveal preferences across all 6 dimensions
2. Score each dimension 1-10 based on responses
3. Call `evaluate_riasec_profile` with the scores
4. Use the resulting code with `calculate_affinity` to find matching careers
5. Present results with context and actionable next steps

## Conversation Guidelines

- Don't rush the assessment — gather quality data over multiple turns
- Validate responses by asking follow-up questions
- Explain what each dimension means in accessible language
- Connect abstract types to concrete everyday examples
